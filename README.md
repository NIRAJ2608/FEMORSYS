# FEMORSYS
FACIAL EMOTION RECOGNITION SYSTEM (full stack project)

Femorsys is an end-to-end facial emotion recognition system built using machine learning and computer vision techniques. This project aims to detect and classify human facial emotions from images or real-time webcam input. It's designed to be a lightweight, efficient, and accurate tool for emotion-based applications in health, marketing, education, and human-computer interaction.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time emotion detection via webcam
- Preprocessing pipeline (face detection, alignment, resizing)
- Emotion classification using a trained deep learning model
- Clean and interactive interface
- Modular and extendable codebase

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras (for model training)
- Streamlit (for deployment / UI)
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)


## 📦 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NIRAJ2608/Femorsys.git
   cd Femorsys
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

##🧠 How It Works
-Load image / video stream
-Detect face using Haar cascades or DNN-based methods
-Preprocess face and normalize
-Pass the face through the emotion classification model
-Display predicted emotion

##🧩 Future Work
-Add support for video file input
-Integrate with web APIs for real-time web emotion analytics
-Improve accuracy with transfer learning (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet)
-Expand to multi-modal emotion recognition
